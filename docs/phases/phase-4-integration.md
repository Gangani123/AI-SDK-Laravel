# Phase 4: Integration — Sidebar Nav, Wayfinder, Wiring

## Objective

Add the Chat link to the app sidebar, generate Wayfinder TypeScript routes, and ensure the full stack is wired together.

## Tasks

### 4a. Sidebar Navigation — `resources/js/components/AppSidebar.vue`

Add to imports:
```typescript
import { MessageSquare } from 'lucide-vue-next';
import { chat } from '@/routes';
```

Add to `mainNavItems` array:
```typescript
{
    title: 'Chat',
    href: chat.index(),
    icon: MessageSquare,
},
```

### 4b. Wayfinder Route Generation
```bash
php artisan wayfinder:generate
```
This generates TypeScript functions in `resources/js/routes/` and `resources/js/actions/` for all new chat routes.

### 4c. Frontend Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Compiles Vue components, Tailwind CSS, and ensures Wayfinder routes are bundled.

## Files Modified
- `resources/js/components/AppSidebar.vue` (modified)
- `resources/js/routes/` (auto-generated by Wayfinder)
- `resources/js/actions/` (auto-generated by Wayfinder)

## Verification
- "Chat" link appears in the sidebar with MessageSquare icon
- Clicking "Chat" navigates to `/chat`
- Active state highlights correctly when on `/chat` routes
- No build errors or warnings
